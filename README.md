# Automating a form with Python

While practicing data analysis and programming, there was a particular form that I needed to complete very often. This took a small amount of time (approx 5-10 mins), but multiplied by the number of times I was required to fill it out, became a huge process. 

So to save time, I automated it with Python using the package PyAutoGUI
